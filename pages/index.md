Oh well, that's my Unix login. Let's ignore that.

So, here's a guy known as "kevinsayhi" in some places, e.g., [apink7china.com](http://www.apink7china.com/index.php).

K-pop these days is by and large tasteless or even poisonous; anyway, there are still some jewels around. My groups of choice include [A Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pink) (hard to tell which song I like the best), [Lovelyz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovelyz) (my favorite song being "Candy Jelly Love"), and formerly [Girls' Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls'_Generation) (my favorite song being "Into the New World"). I can't care less about the rest.

The title of this website, "HSK-pop", is clearly a play on the word "ksh" — short for "kevinsayhi" — and the word "K-pop". However, you may also interpret it as "High Standard K-pop", "Highly Selective K-pop", or whatever you like — just stay away from "Holy Shit K-pop", please.

HSK-pop is a resource hub. At the moment you may find [high quality live performance videos](#live) here.

* <a id="live"></a>**Complete, high quality collections of A Pink and Lovelyz's live performances from TV broadcasts.** By "high quality" I mean 1080i/1080p MPEG-2 or H.264 videos with a typical bitrate of 15 Mbps or more. I hope that one day we'll be dealing with 4K H.265 videos.
